        ___________________  <br>
        
        I started my journey as an IELTS teacher but after sometime I realised the students coming to me were not able to understand the basics of the English language. They were barely able to speak or write it correctly. It was quite disturbing. I started teaching school going students just to understand what they were lacking. To my surprise I observed that in a few schools the students were only made to do the cramming part and they were hardly given any kind of exposure to the real learning.  Recognising the gap I developed specific learning programs which really helped students to enhance their reading skills, learning abilities, mental health, practical aspects of career making amongst many other things. As I kept on learning and improving my knowledge I was able to develop programs for school teachers as well. 
        Meanwhile something remarkable happened. I  worked with a child who was not even willing to study but after putting 8 years of hardwork I was able to draw deep insights on student empowerment.  As a result the boy reached up to the level of obtaining a PhD from an IIT.
        Encouraged from my past success I started developing  a lot of programs for the college students  also. Again the emphasis was on giving them real world exposure with required skill sets and confidence.
        
        I also had a chance to work with a few colleges like  Divine International College where I developed practical programs for the holistic growth of students. I also worked with SVIET where I designed and executed the Entrepreneur Development Programme and in yet another college I gave them a  Personality Development Program and a Happiness Program. For giving them an exposure of various companies I developed a program by interacting with all the stakeholders.
        Working for small kids gave me a firm belief that a child has to be given a joyful, positive, stimulating and encouraging  environment where he or she can fully blossom.  The kids' case studies were shared with B.Ed college students. St. Kabir college of Education is one amongst them.
        My other aim was to create holistic and empowering programmes for the teachers as well.  Soon I was able to develop life oriented holistic educational training programmes based on the best practices of India and abroad.  
        Enlightening senior citizens to age gracefully has always been my concern. After a long research in this area I have designed a Wellness Workshop for the Elderly.
             
        My realisation is - 
        *If you light a lamp for others your own path will also be lighted.* 
        
        My learning journey continues.
        
        Thanks.<br>

      <span class="subheading">Our Success Story</span>
      <p class="mb-2">In the initial phase of this incredible journey, I had a student who struggled with reading English due to his background in Hindi. The transformation from being unable to read English fluently to finishing a book in a day was quite a challenging task. We began enhancing his reading abilities by providing him with appropriate practice, guidance, and instilling the belief that consistent daily effort could lead to learning various skills. Gradually and steadily, he started to improve and increased his speed. After two years of dedicated efforts, he excelled in his English Medium School. <br>
      Simultaneously, he was exposed to the subjects he was studying in commerce, which facilitated his ability to relate theoretical concepts to practical applications. His confidence grew progressively throughout the process, akin to a child's need for guidance, support, encouragement, appreciation, and validation. At his age, it was evident that he received all necessary support, ensuring he remained focused on his objectives whenever he strayed from them. <br>
      It was merely a beginning. Enrolled in college once more, he exposed himself to the real world, and proceeded further. He was gaining real-world experience. Working with him gave me a deeper understanding of what would happen if all children had hands-on instruction, real-world exposure, and communication skills for personal development. After acquiring the mindset and other abilities necessary for success, they are capable of doing wonders. He enrolled in an MBA program, and we once more ensured that he would acquire hands-on experience at national and international conferences. Exposure is important. You begin to experience the actual world and acquire the abilities needed to succeed. <br>
      Before completing his Ph D, he worked as an Assistant Professor. We gained profound insights from the process he underwent in our fostering and guiding atmosphere. If we provide students with the proper resources, direction, and exposure to real-world problems and practical skills outside of the classroom, we can empower them. The science of good emotions, the learning mindset, and mental stability can be of great help. </p>
